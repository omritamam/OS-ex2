Q5:
The main goal of the sigsetjmp function is to save the environment of the running thread (and in particular the relevant
location in the stack - SP, and the current location in the code - PC).
The environment has been saved to the threadâ€™s buffer.
The siglongjmp function extracts the environment of the thread that we want to launch ( saved in the buffer) and jumps
to the place that we call to sigsetjmp.
