Q1:
many algorithms ca
Q2:

New process wont share common data with other processes, unlike threads. That's a good attribute for information security.
In this way each tab get her own each of memory, and the CPU block the process to interact rawly with other process's data.
In the google chrome example - we dont want one website to control data from another tab.
Q3:
any keyboard typing and screen change occurs


Q4:

Q5:
The main goal of the sigsetjmp function is to save the environment of the running thread (and in particular the relevant
location in the stack - SP, and the current location in the code - PC).
The environment has been saved to the threadâ€™s buffer.
The siglongjmp function extracts the environment of the thread that we want to launch ( saved in the buffer) and jumps
to the place that we call to sigsetjmp.
